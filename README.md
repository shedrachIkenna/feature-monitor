# Feature Monitor

## Problem Statement

When a deployed language model starts receiving different requests, or the model itself changes, operators often find out late. Feature Monitor tests whether shifts in one layer's GPT-2 Small activations, encoded as sparse autoencoder features, can flag changes, and compares those alerts with monitoring prompt sentence embeddings using the same drift method. This is an experiment: neither approach is assumed to work better, and results will include null or negative findings.

**Status: in progress**

## Quick Start

```sh
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

The first test run downloads GPT-2 Small and its SAE. `make test-fast` skips the tests that need them.

Run the API (loads the model once at startup):

```sh
uv run uvicorn backend.app:app
curl -X POST localhost:8000/chat -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"prompt": "Hello"}'
```

Endpoints: `GET /health`, `POST /chat`, `GET /features/recent?limit=50`, `GET /features/stats?minutes=60`.

GPT-2 Small is not a chat model, so `/chat` replies are poor continuations of the prompt. That is expected: reply quality is not what we measure. The replies use a fixed seed (40 new tokens at most), so the same prompt always gets the same reply.

See [docs/design.md](docs/design.md) for the design.
